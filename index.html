<h2>Jamaica</h2> <center> <img src="jamaicanbeauty.jpg" alt="makho"; height:"200"; width="400" align= "right"; ></center>
<figcaption>The history of Jamaica is a rich and vibrant one,<br> which inspires
   its people to move forward as a nation. Their history speaks <br> to experiences of hardships
   and prosperity; and the growth and determination of a people.<br> Jamaicaâ€™s history has been
   poetically composed by Howard Pyle, who states: "Jamaica, like <br> many another of the West
   Indian Islands, is like a woman with a history. She has had her <br> experiences and has lived
   her life rapidly. She has enjoyed a fever of prosperity founded upon <br> those incalculable
   treasures poured into her lap by the old time buccaneer pirates.She has <br> suffered earthquake,
   famine, pestilence, fire and death: and she has been the home of cruel merciless slavery,
   hardly second to that practised by the Spaniards themselves. Jamaica has lived through it all in a few <br>
   years." I would love to visit Jamaica to learn about their rich history and their fascinating <br>
   lifestyle and see its kind and beautifull nature displays.

<p> <center><h2>Arawak</h2>
    Arawak is one of the first language that was spoken in Jamaican <br>
    irlands when people where trailed to the irlands of jamaica.<br>
    Interestingly the word Jamaica has been derived from the Arawak<br>
    word 'xaymaca' which means the 'land of wood and water' or the <br>
    'land of forest and water'. Arawak as a language of the Tainos<br> may
    not be in vogue but it has definitely contributed<br> to the enrichment
     of the English language.</center></p> </div>
